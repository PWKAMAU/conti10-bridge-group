        <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
        <p>
            This website is created to clearly inform all members of <strong>Conti 10 Bridge Group</strong> about
            how our profits are shared and to officially communicate an important update regarding our
            group registration status and future direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our aim is transparency, unity, responsibility, and long-term growth of the group.

    <div class="card notice">
        <h2>Important Notice: Group Registration Update</h2>
        <p>
            The group initially applied to be registered as a <strong>Community Based Organization (CBO)</strong>.
            However, the application was <strong>not approved</strong> at this stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            After consultation with a <strong>government officer</strong>, we were officially advised that our
            group structure and objectives are better suited for registration as a
            <strong>Self Help Group</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            The leadership will therefore proceed with registering <strong>Conti 10 Bridge Group</strong>
            as a <strong>Self Help Group</strong> in accordance with government guidelines.

        <h2>Realistic Profit Sharing Example (10 Members)</h2>
        <p>
            To help every member clearly understand how profit sharing works in real life,
            below is a practical example based on our actual group size of <strong>10 members</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Total annual profit:</strong> KES 200,000
        </div>
        <h3>Step 1: Save Group Capital</h3>
        <p>
            As per our constitution, a minimum of <strong>30%</strong> must be retained as group capital.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>30% of KES 200,000 = <strong>KES 60,000</strong> (Saved as group capital)</li>
            <li>Remaining profit for sharing = <strong>KES 140,000</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 2: Break Down the KES 140,000 for Sharing</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Percentage</th>
                <th>Amount (KES)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Contribution</td>
                <td>60%</td>
                <td>84,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Attendance</td>
                <td>20%</td>
                <td>28,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Participation</td>
                <td>20%</td>
                <td>28,000</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Step 3: How Members Benefit Differently</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Very active member:</strong> Contributes consistently, attends most meetings, and participates actively – may earn the highest share from all three categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Average member:</strong> Contributes fairly, attends some meetings, participates occasionally – earns a moderate share.</li>
            <li><strong>Low commitment member:</strong> Poor contribution, low attendance, minimal participation – earns a small share.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive member:</strong> Fails in all areas – may earn little or no profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            This system encourages members to improve contribution, attendance, and participation
            if they want to earn more from group profits.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Final Approval & Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            All profit sharing decisions must be discussed and approved at the
            <strong>Annual General Meeting (AGM)</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            No individual or leadership member may distribute profits without full member approval.
